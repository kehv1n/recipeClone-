      has won me several first place prizes in local competitions. I hope
      it becomes one of your favorites as well! </p>

        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Melt the butter
         in a saucepan. Stir in flour to form a paste. Add water, white sugar

         <li> lace the bottom crust in your pan. Fill with apples, mounded slightly.
         Cover with a lattice work crust. Gently pour the sugar and butter liquid
